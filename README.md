# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction 📊🧠

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and predicting high-risk churners using SQL for data preprocessing, a Python-based ML model, and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Built an end-to-end churn analysis system using **MySQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.
- Performed all data **cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering directly in SQL**.
- Designed a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** to visualize churn patterns across demographics and service usage.
- Trained a machine learning model in **Python** to predict churn likelihood based on processed SQL data.
- Integrated predictions into Power BI to generate interactive insights for business decision-making.
